abstract: Code reuse is an important part of software development. The adoption of
  code reuse practices is especially common among Node.js developers. The Node.js
  package manager, NPM, indexes over 1 Million packages and developers often seek
  out packages to solve programming tasks. Due to the vast number of packages, selecting
  the right package is difficult and time consuming. With the goal of improving productivity
  of developers that heavily reuse code through third-party packages, we present Node
  Code Query (NCQ), a Read-Eval-Print-Loop environment that allows developers to 1)
  search for NPM packages using natural language queries, 2) search for code snippets
  related to those packages, 3) automatically correct errors in these code snippets,
  4) quickly setup new environments for testing those snippets, and 5) transition
  between search and editing modes. In two user studies with a total of 20 participants,
  we find that participants begin programming faster and conclude tasks faster with
  NCQ than with baseline approaches, and that they like, among other features, the
  search for code snippets and packages. Our results suggest that NCQ makes Node.js
  developers more efficient in reusing code.
