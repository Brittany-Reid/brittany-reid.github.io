abstract: 'Open-source projects are essential to software development, but publicly
  disclosing vulnerabilities without fixes increases the risk of exploitation. The
  Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) addresses this issue by promoting robust
  security policies to enhance project security. Current research reveals that many
  projects perform poorly on OpenSSF criteria, indicating a need for stronger security
  practices and underscoring the value of SECURITY.md files for structured vulnerability
  reporting. This study aims to provide recommendations for improving security policies.
  By examining 679 open-source projects, we find that email is still the main source
  of reporting. Furthermore, we find that projects without SECURITY.md files tend
  to be less secure (lower OpenSSF scores). Our analysis also indicates that, although
  many maintainers encourage private reporting methods, some contributors continue
  to disclose vulnerabilities publicly, bypassing established protocols. The results
  from this preliminary study pave the way for understanding how developers react
  and communicate a potential security threat. Future challenges include understanding
  the impact and effectiveness of these mechanisms and what factors may influence
  how the security threat is addressed. '
