abstract: Software developers often reuse code from online sources such as Stack Overflow
  within their projects. However, the process of searching for code snippets and integrating
  them within existing source code can be tedious. In order to improve efficiency
  and reduce time spent on code reuse, we present an automated code reuse tool for
  the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Developer Environment), NLP2TestableCode. NLP2TestableCode
  can not only search for Java code snippets using natural language tasks, but also
  evaluate code snippets based on a user's existing code, modify snippets to improve
  fit and correct errors, before presenting the user with the best snippet, all without
  leaving the editor. NLP2TestableCode also includes functionality to automatically
  generate customisable test cases and suggest argument and return types, in order
  to further evaluate code snippets. In evaluation, NLP2TestableCode was capable of
  finding compilable code snippets for 82.9% of tasks, and testable code snippets
  for 42.9%.
