abstract: The Node.js Package Manager (i.e., npm) archive repository serves as a critical
  part of the JavaScript community and helps support one of the largest developer
  ecosystems in the world. However, as a developer, selecting an appropriate npm package
  to use or contribute to can be difficult. To understand what features users and
  contributors consider important when searching for a good npm package, we conduct
  a survey asking Node.js developers to evaluate the importance of 30 features derived
  from existing work, including GitHub activity, software usability, and properties
  of the repository and documentation. We identify that both user and contributor
  perspectives share similar views on which features they use to assess package quality.
  We then extract the 30 features from 104,364 npm packages and analyse the correlations
  between them, including three software features that measure package ``runnability\";
  ability to install, build, and execute a unit test. We identify which features are
  negatively correlated with runnability-related features and find that predicting
  the runnability of packages is viable. Our study lays the groundwork for future
  work on understanding how users and contributors select appropriate npm packages.
