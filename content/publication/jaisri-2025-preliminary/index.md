abstract: The widespread of libraries within modern software ecosystems creates complex
  networks of dependencies. These dependencies are fragile to breakage, outdated,
  or redundancy, potentially leading to cascading issues in dependent libraries. One
  mitigation strategy involves reducing dependencies; libraries with zero dependencies
  become self-contained. This paper explores the characteristics of self-contained
  libraries within the NPM ecosystem. Analyzing a dataset of 2,763 NPM libraries,
  we found that 39.49% are self-contained. Of these self-contained libraries, 40.42%
  previously had dependencies that were later removed. This analysis revealed a significant
  trend of dependency reduction within the NPM ecosystem. The most frequently removed
  dependency was babel-runtime. Our investigation indicates that the primary reasons
  for dependency removal are concerns about the performance and the size of the dependency.
  Our findings illuminate the nature of self-contained libraries and their origins,
  offering valuable insights to guide software development practices.
